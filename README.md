I've created this blog only using node, express and ejs. You can create new posts, view old ones, and delete them too. However, there is no provision to store the posts. 
1) download all the files into your system
2) open a new gitbash terminal, and cd into this project folder
3) run npm init -y (if needed)
4) run npm i
5) then, run nodemon index.js
6) the project should run on localhost:3000, in your browser
